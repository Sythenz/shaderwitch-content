Articles found here are parts of the Unreal Rendering Architecture that can be called and used directly within Plugins. I will be developing with this in mind, but considering how easy Plugin architecture is in Unreal, this can be placed within Engine/Plugins also. 

In general, it's a good idea to always attempt to write anything in Unreal that does not require engine modification as a plugin, this is a recommendation by Epic as making the engine modular is generally the best approach.
