The purpose of this section of Shaderwit.ch is to give an overview and to document areas of Unreal Engine's render pipeline
that I have explored. Unfortunately, most things found here - with the exception of anything under Plugins - will **require** 
that you run a custom build of the engine since this will require engine modification to proceed.

To learn to build your own version of Unreal Engine please see the [official documentation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/downloading-unreal-engine-source-code).
