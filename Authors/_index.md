As this website progresses, I hope to have multiple contributors who can share their knowledge and expertise on rendering
and developing shaders in Unreal Engine. Here you will find the list of contributors to the website, along with their
socials, and a list of articles they have written or helped write.

Should you wish to contribute, you can message me on Discord (Codekitten) or email me at [Alessa@codekitten.me](mailto:Alessa@codekitten.me).

Alessa ❤️
